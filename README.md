# **Hospital Patient Records Analysis Using Power BI**  

## **1. Project Overview**  
This project analyzes synthetic patient data from Massachusetts General Hospital (2011-2022) to uncover trends in:  
- Patient admissions and readmissions  
- Hospital stays and associated costs  
- Insurance coverage for medical procedures  
- Common medical conditions and diagnoses  

### **Dataset Overview**  
The dataset includes five key tables:  
- **Patients** â€“ Demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, etc.).  
- **Encounters** â€“ Hospital visits, associated costs, and payer details.  
- **Procedures** â€“ Medical procedures performed, along with costs and descriptions.  
- **Payers** â€“ Insurance provider details.  
- **Organizations** â€“ Information on hospitals/clinics.

## **2. Problem Statement**  
Hospitals handle vast amounts of patient data, making it challenging to:  
âœ… Identify trends in **admissions and readmissions**.  
âœ… Assess the **average length of hospital stays**.  
âœ… Optimize **financial strategies** through cost analysis.  
âœ… Evaluate **insurance coverage** for medical procedures.  

A data-driven approach can **streamline hospital operations**, **improve patient outcomes**, and **enhance decision-making**.

## **4. Methodology**  

### **Tools Used**  
- **Power BI** â€“ Data visualization and dashboard creation.  
- **Power Query** â€“ Data cleaning and transformation.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** â€“ Custom calculations and key performance indicators (KPIs).  

### **Data Processing Steps**  

#### **1. Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
âœ” Handled missing values and duplicate records.  
âœ” Standardized date formats for consistency.  
âœ” Categorized records for better segmentation and insights.  

#### **2. Data Modeling**  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/059e5890-dfc8-463e-ae34-99cccd1b7aad)

âœ” Established relationships between **Patients, Encounters, Procedures, Payers, and Organizations** for seamless analysis.  

#### **3. DAX Calculations**  
âœ” Created calculated columns and measures for key metrics, including:  
  - **Length of Stay**  Avg_Length_of_Stay = 
VAR TotalDays = SUMX(
    encounters, 
    DATEDIFF(encounters[Start], encounters[Stop], HOUR) / 24
)
VAR TotalEncounters = COUNT(encounters[Id])

RETURN DIVIDE(TotalDays, TotalEncounters, 0)
  - **Average Cost Per Visit**  Avg_Cost_Per_Visit = 
VAR TotalCost = SUM(encounters[TOTAL_CLAIM_COST]) 
VAR TotalVisits = COUNT(encounters[Id]) 

RETURN DIVIDE(TotalCost, TotalVisits, 0)
  - **Readmission Rates**  Total_Readmissions = 
VAR ReadmittedPatients = 
    SUMX (
        VALUES(encounters[Patient]),  
        IF ( 
            CALCULATE ( COUNT(encounters[Id]), ALLEXCEPT(encounters, encounters[Patient]) ) > 1, 
            1, 
            0 
        )
    )
RETURN
    ReadmittedPatients

  - **Patient Admission** Total_Readmissions = 
VAR ReadmittedPatients = 
    SUMX (
        VALUES(encounters[Patient]),  
        IF ( 
            CALCULATE ( COUNT(encounters[Id]), ALLEXCEPT(encounters, encounters[Patient]) ) > 1, 
            1, 
            0 
        )
    )
RETURN
    ReadmittedPatients

  - **Procedure Insurance Coverage** Procedure Insurance  coverage = CALCULATE(COUNT(encounters[Id]), encounters[PAYER_COVERAGE]>0)

âœ” Designed **interactive reports** to highlight trends in:  
  - **Admissions & Readmissions**  
  - **Hospital Costs & Financial Insights**  
  - **Insurance Coverage**  
  - **Patient Demographics & Conditions**  
âœ” Used **charts, tables, and KPIs** to provide clear data insights.

## **7. Recommendations**  

ðŸ“Œ **1. Improve Data Documentation**  
- Reduce **"Unknown"** reason codes to enhance data quality and diagnosis tracking.  

ðŸ“Œ **2. Optimize Ambulatory Services**  
- Since **ambulatory visits dominate**, allocate more resources to **outpatient services**.  

ðŸ“Œ **3. Strengthen Financial Strategy**  
- With **Medicare covering the majority of payments**, **strategic partnerships** with government-backed insurance providers could improve revenue flow.
